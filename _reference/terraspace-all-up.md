Terraspace provides a reduced-noise summary of the runs. The full logs are also written for further inspection and debugging. The [terraspace log](https://terraspace.cloud/reference/terraspace-log/) command is useful for viewing the logs.

## Using Plans

Using plan output path. You can specify an output path for the plan that contains pattern for expansion. Example:

    $ terraspace all plan --out ":MOD_NAME.plan"

You can then use this later in terraspace up:

    $ terraspace all up --plan ":MOD_NAME.plan"


## Options

```
    [--plan=PLAN]                          # Plan path. Can be a pattern like :MOD_NAME.plan
-y, [--yes], [--no-yes]                    # auto approve all batch commands
    [--exit-on-fail], [--no-exit-on-fail]  # whether or not to exit when one of the batch commands fails
```
