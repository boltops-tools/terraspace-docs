You can install Terraspace as a standalone package.  The nice thing about this approach is that it is easy. You don't have to have Ruby installed. You donâ€™t have to worry about compatible Ruby versions, gems, or conflicting system packages.

Terraspace provides the pre-built binaries. Other tools such as [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), written in ruby, and the [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), written in python, also work the same way.

Important: If you're using rvm or rbenv and already have Ruby installed, you should [install terraspace as a gem]({% link _docs/install/gem.md %}). Otherwise, different gem dependencies from the two installations can be used and cause all kinds of trouble.

Below are quickstart instructions for different OSes.

## Mac OSX

    brew tap boltops-tools/software
    brew install terraspace

## CentOS/RedHat/Fedora

    sudo su
    curl -so /etc/yum.repos.d/boltops.repo https://yum.boltops.com/boltops.repo
    rpm --import https://yum.boltops.com/boltops-key.public
    yum install -y terraspace

    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y terraspace

## How It Works

The standalone installer packages are built within a few minutes of the terraspace gem release. Here are also details on how the standalone installer works: [Standalone Details]({% link _docs/install/standalone/details.md %}).
