[Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) is Bitbucket's Continuous Integration service. It allows you to perform automated steps as "Pipelines" whenever code is pushed, a pull request gets sync, etc. The Pipeline can also be trigger manually.

Next, we'll set up Terraspace CI with Bitbucket Pipelines.
