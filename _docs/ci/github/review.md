We use GitHub Actions to set up CI with Terraspace. The workflow we used was:

1. **Pull Request**: Shows previews of changes using `terraspace plan`
2. **Push**: Automatically updates the infrastructure using `terraspace up` on `TS_ENV=dev`
3. **Workflow Dispatch**: We use to review the changes again and apply to `TS_ENV=prod`

We also configured Terraspace Cloud for the additional features like PR comments that link to the Terraspace Cloud plans, updates, and logs.

This workflow is only one of many possibilities. You have full control over the workflow and can adjust it to your needs. You can run `terraspace up` multiple times or use `terraspace all`.
