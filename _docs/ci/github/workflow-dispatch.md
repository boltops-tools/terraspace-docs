The Workflow Dispatch is generalized and flexible.  It can be use to run any general terraspace command with the GitHub Actions. Let's take a look at it.

.github/workflows/workflow_dispatch.yml

{% raw -%}
```yaml
name: Dispatch Terraspace
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      env:
        description: "TS_ENV"
        type: choice
        options: # Add more environment if needed
          - dev
          - prod
      command:
        description: "Terraspace command to run"
        default: "plan demo"
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      AWS_REGION: us-west-2
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
      TS_ENV: ${{ github.event.inputs.env }}
      TS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TS_TOKEN }}
      # INFRACOST_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TS_TOKEN }} # needed if using cost estimation

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 3.1
        bundler-cache: true # runs 'bundle install' and caches installed gems automatically

    - name: Install
      run:
        .github/bin/install

    - name: Terraspace Command
      run: |
        terraspace ${{ github.event.inputs.command }} -y
```
{% endraw -%}

## Workflow Inputs

A key element of the Workflow Dispatch is that there are inputs. It you to define the inputs to use for job. Here the inputs

* **TS_ENV**: The terraspace env. IE: dev, prod
* **command**: The terraspace command to run. IE: `up demo`, `plan demo`, `destroy demo`, `all up`, etc

## Review Workflow Steps

Now let's review the steps. The first steps deal with installing terraform and terraspace. The final step runs the terraform command you wish.

The `on.workflow_dispatch.inputs.command` key defined at the top maps to the `github.event.inputs.command` in the final step command. This allows you to run any terraspace command you need to.  The starter `workflow_dispatch.yml` is quite flexible.

## Run Workflow

Let's run the workflow dispatch.

1. Go to your repo on GitHub. github.com/ORG/REPO
2. Go to the **Actions** tab
3. Click on the **Terraspace** on the left hand side
4. Click on the right hand side, there's a **Run workflow** dropdown button
5. Leave the values as `TS_ENV=prod` and `command="plan demo"` or change them if you wish
6. Click on **Run workflow**

## Run Workflow

Here's what the Run Workflow button looks like

Since `TS_ENV=dev` has already been run, we can use this workflow to run `TS_ENV=prod`.  Select it and start the job.

## Results

After the job starts, you'll see something like this.

You may have to refresh to see the job running.

If the plan looks good, you can now run the job again with the `up demo` command instead.

The workflow dispatch job is very flexible. It allows you to run pretty much any terraspace command you need. Examples:

    terraspace plan demo
    terraspace up demo
    terraspace down demo
    terraspace all plan
    terraspace all up
    terraspace all down

Next, we'll review what we learned.
