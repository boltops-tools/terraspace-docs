Let's take a look at Pull Request pipeline.

bitbucket-pipelines.yml

{% raw -%}
```yaml
image: ruby:latest

pipelines:
# ...
  pull-requests:
    '**': # this runs as default for any branch not elsewhere defined
      - step:
          script:
            - .bitbucket/bin/install
            - .bitbucket/bin/terraspace plan demo
```
{% endraw -%}

The difference here is that this will create a GitLab pipeline that only runs on `pull_request` events and will run a `terraspace plan`.

## Create Branch and PR

    git checkout feature1
    vim app/stacks/demo/main.tf
    git add .
    git commit -m "change code"
    git push -u origin feature1

To create a Pull Request, you can either go to the url printed out from `git push`

    https://bitbucket.org/ORG/REPO/pull-requests/new?source=feature1&event_source=branch_list

Or go to the branch on GitLab and click "Create Merge Request" on the newly pushed branch.

Fill out the form if you wish and click "Create pull request"

The build should start shortly.

## Logging Details

Click on Details to see the Pipeline Logging output.

A `plan` was run and provided a preview of what would happen. Any additional `git push` to the PR branch will provide updated previews.

If you merge the PR, the [Push Pipeline]({% link _docs/ci/gitlab/push.md %}) that we covered earlier will automatically apply the preview.

Note: Bitbucket CI integration does not support creating a PR comment yet. Pull Requests with improvements are welcomed.

Next, we'll cover the Manual Custom Pipeline.
