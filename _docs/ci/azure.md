[Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops) is an CI service under the [Azure DevOps Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/#overview) umbrella. It allows you to perform automated steps whenever code is pushed.
