title: The Terraspace Community Conduct Guideline
---

We have picked the following conduct guideline based on Ruby's.  We wish for the Terraspace community to be safe, productive, and collaborative. Each Terraspace related community may pick their own Conduct Guideline or Code.

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the Terraspace community. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", which is defined as community communications channels, such as mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to [conduct@boltops.com](mailto:conduct@boltops.com). Persons who do not follow the Conduct Guideline in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project's leadership.
