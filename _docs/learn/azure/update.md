      ~ update in-place

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      # module.storage_account.azurerm_storage_account.this will be updated in-place
      ~ resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" {
            access_tier                    = "Hot"
            account_kind                   = "StorageV2"
            account_replication_type       = "GRS"
            account_tier                   = "Standard"
          ~ enable_https_traffic_only      = true -> false
            ...
            removed to reduce output
            ...
        }

    Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
