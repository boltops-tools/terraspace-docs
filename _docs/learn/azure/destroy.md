Now that we've seen how to deploy infra, let's clean up and tear down the resources.

To destroy the resources, run:

    terraspace down demo

You'll be prompted to make sure you really want to delete these resources.

    $ terraspace down demo
    Building .terraspace-cache/useast/dev/stacks/demo
    Current directory: .terraspace-cache/useast/dev/stacks/demo
    => terraform init -get > /tmp/terraspace/out/terraform-init.out
    Built in .terraspace-cache/useast/dev/stacks/demo
    => terraform destroy
    Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...
    random_pet.this: Refreshing state... [id=wildcat]
    azurerm_resource_group.this: Refreshing state... [id=/subscriptions/61bd6788-c44e-4677-bf0e-6c380785c8a8/resourceGroups/demo-resources-wildcat]
    module.storage_account.azurerm_storage_account.this: Refreshing state... [id=/subscriptions/61bd6788-c44e-4677-bf0e-6c380785c8a8/resourceGroups/demo-resources-wildcat/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/sawildcat]

    An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
    Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      - destroy

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      # azurerm_resource_group.this will be destroyed
      - resource "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
          - id       = "/subscriptions/61bd6788-c44e-4677-bf0e-6c380785c8a8/resourceGroups/demo-resources-wildcat" -> null
          - location = "eastus" -> null
          - name     = "demo-resources-wildcat" -> null
          - tags     = {} -> null
        }

      # random_pet.this will be destroyed
      - resource "random_pet" "this" {
          - id        = "wildcat" -> null
          - length    = 1 -> null
          - separator = "-" -> null
        }

      # module.storage_account.azurerm_storage_account.this will be destroyed
      - resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" {
          - access_tier                    = "Hot" -> null
          - account_kind                   = "StorageV2" -> null
          - account_replication_type       = "GRS" -> null
          - account_tier                   = "Standard" -> null
          - enable_https_traffic_only      = false -> null
          ...
          removed to reduce output
          ...
        }

    Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 3 to destroy.

    Do you really want to destroy all resources?
      Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
      There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

      Enter a value:

Once again, we prompted to `Enter a value:`. Type `yes` and press enter to destroy the infrastructure.

      Enter a value: yes

Congrats! You have successfully created, modified, and destroy infrastructure with terraspace.

Next, we'll look at some next steps.
