Let's go ahead and deploy the infrastructure

    $ terraspace up demo

The `terraspace up` command will build the files and then essentially run `terraform apply`.

    $ terraspace up demo
    Building .terraspace-cache/us-west-2/dev/stacks/demo
    Current directory: .terraspace-cache/us-west-2/dev/stacks/demo
    => terraform init -get -input=false >> /tmp/terraspace/log/init/demo.log
    => terraform apply -input=false

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
    plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

      # random_pet.this will be created
      + resource "random_pet" "this" {
          + id        = (known after apply)
          + length    = 2
          + separator = "-"
        }
      # module.bucket.aws_s3_bucket.this will be created
      + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
          + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)
          + acl                         = (known after apply)
          + arn                         = (known after apply)
          + bucket                      = (known after apply)
          + bucket_domain_name          = (known after apply)
          + bucket_prefix               = (known after apply)
          + bucket_regional_domain_name = (known after apply)
          + force_destroy               = false
          + hosted_zone_id              = (known after apply)
          + id                          = (known after apply)
          + object_lock_enabled         = (known after apply)
          + policy                      = (known after apply)
          + region                      = (known after apply)
          + request_payer               = (known after apply)
          + tags_all                    = (known after apply)
          + website_domain              = (known after apply)
          + website_endpoint            = (known after apply)
        }

    Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Changes to Outputs:
      + bucket_name = (known after apply)

    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

      Enter a value:

You get shown what will be provisioned and prompted with `Enter a value:`

Type `yes` and press enter and you'll see terraform apply finishing.

      Enter a value: yes
    random_pet.this: Creating...
    random_pet.this: Creation complete after 0s [id=discrete-quetzal]
    module.bucket.aws_s3_bucket.this: Creating...
    module.bucket.aws_s3_bucket.this: Creation complete after 1s [id=bucket-discrete-quetzal]

    Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:


    bucket_name = "bucket-discrete-quetzal"
    $

You can see the bucket got created.

Note, you can also use the `-y` option to bypass the prompt. IE: `terraspace up demo -y`.

Next, we'll make some changes to the infrastructure code.
