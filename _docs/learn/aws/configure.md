Configure AWS so Terraspace can connect to it. The recommended way is to:

1. set up the `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` files
2. set up your `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION` environment variables

## Example

~/.aws/config

    [profile dev]
    output = json
    region = us-west-2

~/.aws/credentials

    [dev]
    aws_access_key_id = REPLACE_ME
    aws_secret_access_key = REPLACE_ME

In your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`, use this line to set the `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION` environment variables:

    export AWS_PROFILE=dev
    export AWS_REGION=`aws configure get region` # to match what's in ~/.aws/config

The reason we have to configure `AWS_REGION` also, is because Terraform doesn't seem to use the `~/.aws/config` setting, but will use the `AWS_REGION`.

## Test AWS Setup

Here are some useful commands to test that the AWS CLI is working:

    aws sts get-caller-identity
    aws s3 ls

Next, we'll create a new project.
