The `config/terraform` folder is for common configurations. All files in the folder get built and included with the deployed module. Common examples:

* [Backend Config]({% link _docs/config/backend.md %}): configure which backend to use by default. IE: S3
* [Provider Config]({% link _docs/config/provider.md %}): configure which provider to use by default. IE: AWS
* [Terraform Tfvars]({% link _docs/config/tfvars.md %}): Tfvars you want always set.
* [Locals]({% link _docs/config/locals.md %}): Locals you want always available.

## Processing

{% include config/processing.md %}

Note: Files in the `files` folder are copied straight over to the build cache without any processing regardless of extension.  IE: `app/stacks/demo/files/example.rb`.  More docs:  [Pass Files]({% link _docs/config/pass-files.md %})

## Overridable

The `config/terraform` is for common configurations. They're overridable within each module itself, though. For example:

* config/terraform/backend.tf - common configuration
* app/stacks/demo1 - does not have a backend.tf
* app/stacks/demo2/backend.tf - overrides backend.tf

When Terraspace builds the stacks, `demo1` uses `config/terraform/backend.tf` and `demo2` uses `app/stacks/demo2/backend.tf`. Files within the stack have higher precedence than the `config/terraform` files.

Note, since terraspace provides a little extra power with ERB templating, you can also have dynamic ERB logic in the `config/terraform` files. It's up to you, Terraspace gives you options.

The next docs cover different ways to leverage config.
