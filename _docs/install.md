There are several ways to install Terraspace.

1. [Gem]({% link _docs/install/gem.md %}): This is a great way if you already have Ruby on your system.
2. [Standalone Installer]({% link _docs/install/standalone.md %}): This is a great way if you don't yet have Ruby installed, and want a quick and easy way to install Terraspace. There are installers for [Mac OSX]({% link _docs/install/standalone/macosx.md %}), [CentOS]({% link _docs/install/standalone/centos.md %}), [Ubuntu]({% link _docs/install/standalone/ubuntu.md %}), etc.
3. [Docker]({% link _docs/install/docker.md %}): This is a great way if you want to try out Terraspace in an isolated Docker container.
