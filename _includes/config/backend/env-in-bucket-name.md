## Why Is Env in Bucket Name?

By default, the bucket name has the `ENV` at the end. This is done so we can easily see which environment the bucket stores Terraform statefiles for. This quickly helps with debugging. If you prefer not to have the `ENV` at the end of the bucket name, remove it after generating the project with `terraspace new project`.
